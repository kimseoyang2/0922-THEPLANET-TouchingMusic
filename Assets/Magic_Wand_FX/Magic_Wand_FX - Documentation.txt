Load "Magic_Wand_FX" for an example scene, or simply drag magic wand  from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Note that if you want the wand magic to hit objects in the environment you'll need to add the target meshes to the particle effect; select the Fire_Bolt_A particle effect in the Hierarchy window (under "Wand_FX"), then in the Inspector window (on the right) scroll down to Triggers. Then drag in the collision meshes from the Hierarchy window into the Colliders slots. More collider slots can be added by hitting the "+" on the right hand side of the window.

Have fun!
